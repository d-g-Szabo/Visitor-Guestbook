# week03-assignment

Project: Build a Cookie Clicker Game

# Requirements:

🎯 Create a page containing a form to leave a message and a list of all the messages that have been left.

🎯 Style the form and the messages so they're easy to read on multiple kinds of device.

🎯 Create an API POST route to accept the text from your message input form

🎯 Create a database to store the messages, and create a seed file to create the table

🎯 Create an API GET route to retrieve all the messages from the database

🎯 Fetch the messages from your API in the browser and display them on the page.

Stretch Goals:

🏹 Add a delete button to each message, that sends a request to the server to delete the message

🏹 Add a like button to each message, that sends a separate request to the server to increment the likes on the message

I met all the requirements for this assignment. Did not have enough time this weeked to do the stretch goals but I will come back and do them during the week.

# Reflections:

What went really well and what could have gone better?

Getting the data from the database and displaying them on the webpage was pretty easy.

Useful external sources:

- None (exept the previus days code)

Describing errors or bugs you encountered:

I encountered a bug when fetching the data from the API. Standard promise problem, fixed it with providing async and await to every place it needed.

Requesting feedback about a specific part of your submission:

Well, I would like to get some general feedback on the structure of my code.
